First game using C++ sfml

I had the idea  of making this game in february 2019 and I coded it during summer. 
You can find screenshots of the game in 'images'.
Right now I haven't got the time to continue the development but the concept that I had in mind is there.
I fixed all the bugs I found during development but there may be some that I didn't find.
